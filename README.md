# Decentralized Voting Application on Ethereum
Welcome to the Decentralized Voting Application built on the Ethereum blockchain. This application allows users to participate in a transparent and secure voting process using Ethereum smart contracts.

# Overview
The Decentralized Voting Application is designed to facilitate a simple voting process where users can propose new voting topics, vote on them, and view the results in real-time. The application ensures that once a topic's voting period has ended, no more votes can be cast for that topic.
